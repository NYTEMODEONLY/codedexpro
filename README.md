### Why CodeDex Pro?

While the Pok√©mon TCG Online app allows you to scan codes, it's a tedious, one-at-a-time process. CodeDex Pro was built by collectors for collectors, addressing the real-world need of scanning and managing large quantities of codes efficiently.

- **One-Click Copy**: Copy all codes or specific blocks with a single click
- **File Export**: Save your codes as TXT or Markdown files for easy sharing or archiving
- **Sleek, Modern UI**: Dark-themed professional interface that's easy on the eyes
- **Local Processing**: All scanning and processing happens locally - your codes never leave your computer
